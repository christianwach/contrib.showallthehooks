# Civi Developer

Probably should be replaced "hook demo" or something because it's not really a
tool you'd want as a developer.

## TODO

* Replace Drupal functions with Core functions
* Make a centralised "hook X ran with args: a,b" display
* If Drupal dpm etc is available, use it, else use Civi debug
* Replace all the hook implementations with a dynamic generator
